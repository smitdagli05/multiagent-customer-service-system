## Key Components

### Custom Agents

Our system is built around three specialized agents, each tailored to fulfill a specific role within the support process:

1. **Support Agent**: This agent acts as the frontline responder to all incoming customer queries. It accesses a detailed directory of current product information and customer feedback to provide precise and informed responses. The Support Agent uses advanced natural language processing techniques to understand and generate relevant responses, ensuring high customer satisfaction.

2. **Support Quality Assurance Agent**: After the initial response, this agent reviews the draft to ensure that it meets Mattermost's high standards for accuracy and completeness. The Quality Assurance Agent also verifies that the response maintains a friendly and professional tone, enhancing the customer's experience.

3. **Query Classifier Agent**: This agent classifies incoming queries into categories such as feature requests, bug reports, or general inquiries. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that customer feedback is appropriately routed, aiding in the swift and effective resolution of issues and the identification of potential improvements.

### Custom Tasks

Each agent is assigned specific tasks that define their responsibilities:

- **Resolve Inquiry**: Managed by the Support Agent to draft a comprehensive and accurate initial response based on the customer's inquiry.
- **Quality Assurance Review**: Conducted by the Support Quality Assurance Agent to refine the response, ensuring it meets all required standards before reaching the customer.
- **Classify Query**: Handled by the Query Classifier Agent, this task involves analyzing and categorizing the customer's query to streamline the support process and facilitate easier management of feedback and requests.

### Integration Tools

To support these agents and tasks, the system employs several integration tools:

- **DirectorySearchTool**: Enables agents to quickly search through directories containing current product information and customer feedback, ensuring that all responses are backed by up-to-date data.
- **SerperDevTool**: A development tool integrated into our system for enhanced performance and debugging capabilities, ensuring smooth operation of the agents during their tasks.

## Technologies

The Mattermost Support System leverages a combination of cutting-edge technologies and established software practices:

- **crewai**: A versatile framework that allows for the creation, management, and execution of agent-based tasks. It provides the infrastructure for our agents, facilitating complex interactions and processes within our system.
- **langchain_openai**: Integrates OpenAI's GPT models, specifically chosen for their state-of-the-art natural language processing capabilities. These models help in understanding customer queries and generating human-like responses.
- **Python**: Chosen for its wide support and flexibility, Python serves as the foundation of our system, enabling rapid development and integration of various libraries and tools.
- **JIRA API**: Used for tracking feature requests and bug reports, integrating directly with our project management workflow. This allows for seamless updates and tracking of issues raised by customers.
- **Environment Variables and Configuration Management**: Utilizing libraries like `decouple` and `dotenv`, our system securely manages sensitive information, ensuring that API keys and other configurations are kept secure.

These components and technologies work in concert to provide a responsive, accurate, and efficient support system that enhances the user experience and supports Mattermost's commitment to exceptional customer service.
